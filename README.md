# Trial Tracker Introduction
<p>Trial Tracker is designed for managing monthly and yearly subscriptions and provides a comprehensive overview of various subscription-based services. Trial Tracker enables the tracking of ongoing, expired, and upcoming subscription trials, ensuring users can evaluate the value of services before committing financially. With monthly and yearly tracking features, users can monitor their spending habits, receive notifications for renewal deadlines, and make informed decisions about which subscriptions to continue or cancel.</p>

## Project Planning
The team engaged in a collaborative brainstorming session using Figma to visualize our concepts and strategize the project's roadmap. Defining the project's goals was an important first step, followed by crafting user stories to pinpoint the MVP requirements. This planning approach ensured we focused on delivering the core functionality of the application.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to add a new subscription to my list, so I can keep track of all my subscriptions and set up end of trial periods in one place.
- As a user, I want to view all my subscriptions, so I can easily see what I'm currently subscribed to.
- As a user, I want to update the details of an existing subscription, so I can keep the information current with any changes in my subscriptions.
- As a user, I want to delete a subscription from my list, so I can keep my list updated with only active subscriptions.
- As a user, I want to sign-up for an account so that I can securely manage and track my subscriptions. 
- As a user with multiple subscriptions, I want to access my dashboard so that I can view my monthly/annual billing metrics and decide whether to continue, modify, or cancel a subscription.
